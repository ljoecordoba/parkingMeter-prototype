This is a prototype of an hypotetic system of parking meter.
I said hipotetic because this was a project for the university( Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento, Argentina)
It was in the subject Software Engineering.
We used the HTML,Javascript,CSS, and AJAX. Also we worked with the library Leaflet and markerCLuster.
